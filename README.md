# Data and code for Lai et al. (2024) *Biotropica*

Welcome! This is a data and code repository for the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.70002):

> Lai H.R., Chong K.Y., Wong M.Q.Y., Tan H.T.W., Yeo D.C.J. (2025) Leaf-litter depth, not canopy openness, mediates the occurrence of an invasive shrub from the forest edge to interior. *Biotropica*, 57, e70002

This study originated as the [undergraduate thesis of Wong M.Q.Y](https://go.exlibris.link/M1bwppYt).

# Usage

The sequence to run the codes is `model.R`, `effects.R` and then `predictions.R` in the `data` folder.

Please feel free to submit a GitHub issue if you encounter any problem. 

# Notes

For curious minds who wants to delve deeper into Bayesian structural equation / path modelling, our crude approach probably won't stand the test of time; please take a look at the discussions [here](https://github.com/jebyrnes/bayesian_sem/issues/6) and [here](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/issues/303) --- these brighter minds might have already developed more robust tools when you land on this page. Have fun.
